<h1>Our Story</h1>
<h2>The Engagement</h2>
<p>Downtown Madison was the first stop on their five-hour drive from Giovanna's parents' home in Shorewood to the AirBnB we would be staying at on the way to visit Jake's family in Ashland. We were used to the Phoenix summers, but nothing could have prepared us for the 95-degree, 85-percent humidity we would experience on our walk around Madison. We reminisced about our college days and the fun we had as heatstroke and dehyrdration began to set in. Meanwhile, Jake had a surprise he had been waiting to give Giovanna.</p>
<p>~ ~ ~</p>
<p><i>Jake and Giovanna met through a friendship between their roommates. When they moved into apartments across the street from each other, Jake and his roommates yelled over to Giovanna and her roommates inviting them to a party they were throwing. Later that same week, Giovanna and her roommates needed the boys to come eradicate a pest in their apartment. When the boys showed up weilding giant decorative wooden cutlery, Giovanna was intrigued. She and Jake continued to keep in touch and bump into each other at parties over the next year. Finally, they were both single at the same time.</i></p>
<p><i>A year after they had met, they decided to hang out one-on-one. They went for a run one day to the arboretum and enjoyed the time and conversation so much that they scheduled a dinner together later that night. Dinner went so well that they went for a long walk after and had their first kiss on the Mendota Terrace while music played in the background and the sun set over the lake.</i></p>

<p>The conversation shifted from college memories to finding shade and water, while Jake frantically planned an inconspicuous detour to the location of his surprise. He steered the couple toward the Social Sciences building pointing to the clock tower that would play a tune every Badger would remember. Then he pointed to Van Vleck and the couple steered toward it sharing Calculus war stories. They were getting extremely close to the location Jake planned to reveal his surprise. He just had to find a way to stop Giovanna for a moment.</p>

<p><i>School was difficult for the couple in the winter of their Junior year, each having a difficult courseload. At least there was one thing that they would each look forward to as they rushed between classes on those frigid winter days. There was a place where they would cross each others' paths and have a minute or two to spare. Jake might wave and yell, or pretend like he didn't know who she was, but Giovanna would always pull off the path with him and they would take comfort in sharing how their days were going and whatever else was on their minds.</i></p>

<p>It was at that place, 5 years later, that Jake made his move outside Ingraham hall. "Let's sit for a minute in the shade," as he made a bee-line for a bench. Before Giovanna sat down to join him, she noticed a few wasps and ran off down the path. Running to catch up, Jake urged her to sit so that they could catch their breath and avoid heat exhaustion. They agreed to sit under a tree outside Ingraham on a bench where Giovanna asked Jake why he chose pants on such a hot day. To which he replied, "at least pants are good for one thing, kneeling."</p>
<p>Jake got down on a knee and pulled out a ring asking Giovanna if she would marry him. Tears in her eyes, she said "yes!"</p>
<h2>The Wedding</h2>
<p>Filled with excitement and happiness, the couple found water as soon as they could before getting back in the car to finish the rest of their drive. They started discussing the logistics of a wedding and decided that they would be married on Spring of 2024 in Arizona. Giovanna had always wanted a long engagement and she expects to graduate from school at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Arizona holds a special place in the couple's relationship. They both took a leap of faith by moving across the country to live there. Maybe an equally faithful decision in signing a lease together and living alone with each other for the first time. When they became engaged, they had been living in Arizona for four years and made many memories together there.</p>
<p>Over the years in Arizona, Giovanna had made an incredible career change, worked several jobs, and founded a non-profit with Jake. Jake had began his career in Software Engineering and made several career moves. The couple bought their first home in Fountain Hills, a subdivision of Scottsdale. They've travelled around the state and around the southwest. They've made friends.</p>
<p>Gio and Jake can't wait to share this special place with those who they love on their big day!</p>
